# Dagger2, Spark, and Gradle

This is just a small webservice I created to explore what a webservice
written using Spark and Dagger2 might look like. I also made use of
Gradle as the build tool since I had not used it outside of the android
world. The service itself simply exposes a "People" end point that you
can perform CRUD operations against. I wrote a small blog post on this 
here: http://blog.abnormallydriven.com/2017/02/28/creating-a-restful-web-service-with-sparkjava-dagger2-and-gradle/
